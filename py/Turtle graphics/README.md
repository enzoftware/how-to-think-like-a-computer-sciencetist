# Simple drawing with turtle

### “Turtle” is a python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it!
Before you can use turtle, you have to import it. We recommend playing around with it in the interactive interpreter first, as there is an extra bit of work required to make it work from files. Just go to your terminal and type:
```python
import turtle
```
You can use functions like turtle.forward(...) and turtle.left(...) which can move the turtle around.
## Note
#### Do you work with Ubuntu and get the error message “No module named _tkinter”? Install the missing package with 
```python
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
